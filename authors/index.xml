      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz, working with Prof. C. Seshadhri. Prior to that, I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from Dartmouth College, where I was advised by Prof. Amit Chakrabarti. I completed my masters at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) under the supervision of Prof. Amit Kumar. Before that, I was an undergraduate student at Jadavpur University. Somewhere in between, I have spent a couple of years at IBM Research Lab (New Delhi) and Adobe India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research is broadly on the topic of foundations of data science. In particular, I focus on large graph analysis. My work lies in the intersection of theoretical computer science and data mining. I also study algorithmic fairness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have enjoyed working on approximation algorithms and arithmetic circuit complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
