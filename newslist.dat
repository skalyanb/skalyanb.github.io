* **[Mar 2022]** At [Katana Graph](https://katanagraph.com/), we have developed a simple graph neural network (gnn) based AI model SimGCN that is dominating the leaderboards at [TDC](https://tdcommons.ai/) [ADMET Benchmark Group](https://tdcommons.ai/benchmark/admet_group/overview/)! Check out our [report](https://github.com/KatanaGraph/SimGCN-TDC/blob/main/Report_SimGCN_for_TDC_Benchmarks.pdf) and [Github repo](https://github.com/KatanaGraph/SimGCN-TDC).
